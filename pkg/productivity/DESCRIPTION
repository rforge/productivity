Description:
  Levels and changes of productivity and profitability are measured with various indices.
  In addition to the classic Malmquist productivity index, the package contains also 
  the multiplicatively complete Färe-Primont, Fisher, Laspeyres, Lowe, Paasche, 
  and Hicks-Moorsteen (and its components, i.e. Malmquist-hs and Malmquist-it) indices. 
  Färe-Primont and Lowe indices verify the transitivity property and can therefore be used for 
  multilateral or multitemporal comparison.
  Fisher, Laspeyres, Malmquist, Paasche, and Hicks-Moorsteen (and components) indices are not 
  transitive and are only to be used for binary comparison. 
  All indices can also be decomposed into different components, providing insightful information 
  on the sources of productivity and profitability improvements. 
  In the use of Malmquist productivity index, the technological change index can be further 
  decomposed into bias technological change components. 
  In the case of the Fisher, Laspeyres, Paasche, Hicks-Moorsteen (and components) and the transitive 
  Färe-Primont and Lowe indices, it is furthermore possible to rule out technological change. 
  Deflated shadow prices are also returned.
  The package also allows to prohibit negative technological change. 
  All computations are carried out with the nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), 
  and several assumptions regarding returns to scale are available.
  The package allows parallel computing as an option, depending on the user's computer configuration.
